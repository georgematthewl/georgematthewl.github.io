                A few days before my second semester end, I tried to apply for intership program, because I think my 3
                months will be useless if I do nothing. Then while searching for intership program, I suddenly found job
                vacancy by Fabelio, I got excited because I think that I fulfill the requirements then I apply. When I
                apply
                and sent the email, I don’t expect much that I would be called by the HR because I’m only on my second
                semester and still have zero experience in work environment. But later after class, I suddenly called by
                the
                HR and they said that they interested with my profile and called me for an interview, I’m so happy. The
                next
                day, I went to the office and got interviewed around an hour. At first, I interviewed by HR then they
                called
                the IT Lead for the second interviewer. Surprisingly, the IT Lead like my profile and he said that he
                want
                to give me a chance as an intern at Fabelio.<br>

                <br>On Tuesday, 5th June 2018, I started my internship program with Fabelio. The IT team is really
                humble and
                friendly. I became a web developer intern here, I got many new knowledge from the last 3 months working
                here. The other teammate really taught me a lot about work environment. And I feel so lucky to be given
                opportunity to work here.
